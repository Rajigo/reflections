When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  It is necessary when you want to share the code with other people and enable them to collaborate and propose changes to your code,
  or jointly work on a project with a group of people.
  The repository could be public or private, depending on the situation. Keeping the files on the cloud is also safer than keeping it only local.
